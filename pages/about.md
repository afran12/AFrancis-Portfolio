## About the Artist
Aftan Francis makes art and she travels. Put 'em together, and you get this page.
Aftan has been a casual creator her entire life, but didn't discover her love of formal art processes, such as oil painting and ceramic sculpture, until unexpectedly majoring in Art Education in college. Aftan considers herself fortunate to have had opportunities to travel as a teacher and Peace Corps volunteer, and she loves learning about new cultures and incorporating what she learns into what she makes.
